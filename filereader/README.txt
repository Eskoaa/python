In this project the idea was to receive sensor data from a temperature and movement sensors that gets saved to .csv format.
the sample file uno_data.csv is an output file from the sensors. Originally the idea was to use the setup in a revolving
door. If motion was detected, the door would open and if not the door would close thus saving money. Due to the
inaccuracies of the sensors the project was scrapped. What remains is the filereader.py that I wrote to sort through
the output data.
